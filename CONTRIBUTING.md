# Contributing to Crana

Thank you for considering to contribute to Crana!
Together we can make crana the best tool of its kind. But we need __YOU__ to make that happen!

As an inspiration, you can have a look at the Roadmap section of this page. But any other contribution is also welcome, the roadmap below just contains some ideas where you could start. It would even be a very helpful contribution if you added something to the roadmap!

##  Roadmap
- Improve documentation
- Improve contribution guide
    - Issue template
    - ...any ideas?
- Create a simple website
- Developers should be able to customize every aspect of crana (directly customizing configurations per project)
- Implement sort of a plugin system
- Add deployment automations + deployment guides
- Open an issue/start a pull request if you have more ideas!

## Development environment
Getting started with development is really straight forward:
- __Step 1__: Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scriptify/crana.git
    ```
- __Step 2__: Install the dependencies
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
- __Step 3__: Create a symlink to the package, so you can use it directly in your CLI.
    ```bash
    npm link
    ```
- __Step 4__: Start hacking!
