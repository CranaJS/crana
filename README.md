# App.It
## A CLI tool to create React + Node apps with just one command

Just do:

```bash
npm i -g app-it
app-it <projectName> [projectFolder]
```

...and you are ready to go!

## Technologies
As soon as you bootstrapped a new Project, you have an application running with:

- Node.js Backend (tranpiled by babel)
- React for frontend

## Roadmap
- Create better documentation
- Use webpack for server too
- Better decouple source folder from "app.it"
- Implement possiblity to add own "app.it" plugins
- Implement updating to a newer version of "app.it"
